# Theory_of_Computation_485
Repository which contains my semester project for my Introduction to the Theory of Computation Class.
This project is a deterministic finite automata state checker. It takes in an input file which labels specific states like starting state, ending state, etc... and then paths out the states and determined if the input DFA is true or not.
